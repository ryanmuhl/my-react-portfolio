## Purpose
Create application so that a future employer can view my deployed React portfolio of work samples  so that they can assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.

## Website Functionality
* When Portfolio is loaded,  User is presented with a page containing a Header, Section for Content, and a Footer.
* When the user view's the header,  the user is then presented with the developers name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
* When the user views the navigation titles,  the user is then presented with titles including About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.  Each Link is highlighted when cursor is placed    over the link.
* When a user selects a link,  they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
* When the portfolio is loaded for the first time,  the About me content is displayed by default. 
* When the user is presented with the About Me section,  a recent photo is displayed including a short bio. 
* When the user is presented with the Contact section, the user sees a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
* When the user moves the curser out of one of the form fields without entering text,  a notification is displayed that this field is requred.
* When user enters text into the email field,  user is notified if the email address is invalid. 
* When the user is presented with the Resume section,  the user will see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of developer proficiencies.
* When the user is presented with a footer,  the footer contains links to the developer's Github and alternate personal sites.
